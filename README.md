'Mangungutang' - is the Filipino word which translates to 'Debtor' in English.

The purpose of this project is to help those debtors to record their peasants who borrows some money from them.

This project website created by yours truly has no intention of getting or pulling some data from the user's of this project (if there will be users). Thus, this website will not get any data from the users because the users will use localStorage for saving the records and not server based database.

Also this project is my stepping stone towards my learning in Web development and Software Engineering.
